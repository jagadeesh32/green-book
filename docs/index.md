# Introduction

This is my personal digital resource where I share everything. As a Software Engineer, I learned about a huge variety of topics in work life like [project management](project-management/index.md), [software architecture](software-architecture/index.md), [cloud computing](cloud-computing/index.md), [machine learning](machine-learning/index.md), [python](python/index.md), [node.js](node-js/index.md), [golang](golang/index.md), [rust](rust/index.md), and [databases](databases/index.md).

Unlike other blogs, articles, I will continuously update this book based on my experience because resources will always change every time. so no more hesitate if you learn from different topics from here.
